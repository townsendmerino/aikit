// at all. A device-to-device copy is therefore a memcpy between two mapped
// slices — the PCIe round trip this verb exists to eliminate on CUDA does not
// exist on this backend, so there is no speedup to report and none is claimed.
//
// It is here for API symmetry. The alternative is that every consumer targeting
// both backends writes a build-tagged branch around a call that is available on
// one of them, which is a worse outcome than a function that is merely
// unremarkable on darwin. The CUDA half carries the measurements and the
// synchronization hazard; see cuda_copy.go.
