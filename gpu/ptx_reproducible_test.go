// TestPTXReproducible rebuilds every shipped .ptx from its .cu and requires the bytes to
// match exactly.
//
// WHY. The PTX is a build-time artifact that ships in the binary via //go:embed, and an
// artifact you cannot regenerate is one you cannot review or audit. goinfer's glue.ptx
// carried a symbol its glue.cu no longer generated for MONTHS, undetected, because
// nothing tied the artifact to its source. aikit ships four such artifacts under four
// CUDA consumers; before this test, nothing tied any of them to anything.
//
// It is also the assertion that makes the histogram below meaningful: the histogram reads
// the COMMITTED PTX, and this test is what establishes that the committed PTX is what the
// committed source actually compiles to.
//
// THE HARNESS WAS VALIDATED, AND HERE IS HOW — because a green reproducibility test is a
// claim like any other, and a comparison that cannot fail would look identical to a clean
// tree. Mutation-checked on 2026-07-31 (nvidia-rtx2070s, NVRTC 12.9.86) three ways:
//
//   - Changing __fmaf_rn -> __fmul_rn in a COMMENT produced byte-identical PTX. Correct:
//     comments do not reach codegen. This is also what lets the BIT-IDENTITY-CONTRACT
//     declarations be added to the .cu headers without invalidating a single artifact.
//   - Changing the same token in real code (gemv_quant.cu's `facc = __fmaf_rn(...)` ->
//     a bare `facc + p0*s`) produced DIFFER, at the expected file.
//   - Restoring the source produced AGREE again.
//
// A byte difference here means one of two things, and the message says which to check
// first: the .ptx was edited by hand or left stale after a .cu change (the glue.ptx
// failure), or the toolchain moved. The version guard below rules out the second before
// the comparison runs, so a reported DIFFER is drift.
//
// On a diff, split bodies on the `}` terminator rather than entry-to-entry — an
// entry-to-entry splitter mis-attributes trailing metadata and produced a residual false
// alarm in goinfer.

// gemv_w8a8_fwd compiled to 11 fma + 3 mul (mul+add — the compiler declining to fuse)
// while goinfer's batched counterpart compiled to 192 fma + 0 mul, and that mismatch was
// an 84% token-stream divergence on real weights. No numerical test found it: uniform
// random fixtures lack the dynamic range to expose a ~1 ULP data-dependent split, which is
// why aikit's tolerance-based gemv parity test passed throughout.
//
// It reads the COMMITTED artifact, so it needs no NVRTC, no GPU and no rebuild, and runs
// in every job. TestPTXReproducible is what ties that artifact back to the source.
//
// The single mul is deliberate: gemv_w8a8_fwd's two-scale product is an explicit
// __fmul_rn (there is no accumulate to fuse it with).
//
// THE EXPECTED COUNTS ARE VERSION-COUPLED: 13/1 holds at NVRTC 12.9.86, the version every
// committed artifact records and the version TestPTXReproducible pins. A toolchain bump can
// legitimately move them.
//
// THAT IS ALSO THE RISK. The failure mode this gate must survive is not the counts moving —
// it is someone making a red test green by editing the constants. A DROP IN fma.rn.f32 WITH
// A MATCHING RISE IN mul.f32 IS THE SIGNATURE OF THE ORIGINAL DEFECT, not a version
// artifact: it means the compiler chose mul+add where the contract requires fusion, which is
// precisely how gemv_w4a8_fwd shipped at 11 fma + 3 mul against its batched counterpart's
// 192 fma + 0 mul. Re-baselining that away reinstates an 84% token-stream divergence and
