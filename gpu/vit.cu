// vit.cu — the kernel set for a native, cgo-free ViT forward (docs/task-native-gpu.md,
// Phase 3). These are aikit's own compute, built on the cuda.go device layer, and they
// exist to run vision.ResidentEncoder on NVIDIA the way goinfer's WebGPU backend runs it
// on any GPU — but cgo-free.
//
// BIT-IDENTITY-EXEMPT: no bit-identity contract exists for this tower, so the bare float
// MACs below are free to contract. The gate is gpu/visioncuda/encoder_test.go, which
// requires cosine >= 1-1e-6 against the pure-Go CPU tower — a TOLERANCE, deliberately:
// that tower accumulates LayerNorm/softmax/GELU in float64 while these kernels work in
// f32/int32, so bit-equality is impossible BY CONSTRUCTION, not merely unachieved. The
// int8 dots are exact, so the residual divergence is float reassociation only, which is
// why the bar is tight rather than loose. Nothing downstream consumes these outputs
// bit-for-bit. If that ever changes — if some path must match this kernel exactly — flip
// this to BIT-IDENTITY-CONTRACT and expect real work: the reductions here are unprotected.
//
// Related, and NOT the same claim: gpu/metal_vit.go pins its threadgroup width
// (ViTBlock/LNBLOCK) as a bit-identity dependency. That is about the Metal kernel matching
// ITSELF across configurations — a perf sweep of the width silently moves its bits and the
// tolerance gate would not notice — not about matching the CPU tower. gpu/cuda_vit.go's
// ViTBlock carries the same structural coupling but documents it only as an array size.
//
// PARITY IS THE POINT, SO THE MATH MIRRORS THE CPU TOWER EXACTLY
// --------------------------------------------------------------
// Every kernel here is written against vision/encoder.go's arithmetic, not against
// "standard" formulations, because the gate is cosine ≈ 1.0 against that CPU forward:
//   - layernorm accumulates mean and variance in DOUBLE and applies
//     (x-mean)*rsqrt(var+eps)*w + b, matching layerNormInto. eps is added to the
//     VARIANCE, not to the deviation.
//   - gelu is the TANH approximation with c = sqrt(2/pi), evaluated in double —
//     geluTanh. Not erf-gelu; they differ enough to move a cosine.
//   - softmax subtracts the row max, exponentiates and sums in DOUBLE — softmaxRow.
//   - attention is BIDIRECTIONAL (no causal mask) and scales scores by 1/sqrt(hd)
//     BEFORE the softmax.
// Turing runs fp64 at 1/32 rate, so the double accumulations are deliberately confined
// to the per-row reductions (a vanishing fraction of a tower's FLOPs) where they buy
// parity; every bulk matmul stays in int32/f32.
//
// Conventions from gpu/cuda.go: scalars by value, each kernel bounds-checks its own
// global index (a CUDA launch rounds up to whole blocks), and weight matrices are
// ROW-MAJOR [N,K] — i.e. the B-transposed layout linalg.MatmulBT uses, so a GEMM here
// is C[m,n] = dot(A[m,:], B[n,:]).

// TILED GEMMs (throughput). The gemm_w8a8 / gemm_f32 above are correctness-first:
// one thread per output element, each re-reading a whole row of A and of B from
// global memory. At ViT shapes that is the dominant cost — every A row is re-read N
// times and every B row M times.
//
// These tile through shared memory instead: a TILE×TILE block cooperatively stages
// one A-tile and one B-tile per K-chunk, so each element is read from global memory
// once per tile rather than once per output. Same arithmetic, same operand order
// within a thread's accumulation.
//
// The W8A8 variant is expected to be BIT-IDENTICAL to the untiled one, and its test
// asserts exactly that: the accumulator is int32 and integer addition is associative,
// so re-chunking the K loop cannot change the result. That is a much sharper gate than
// a tolerance, and it is available here precisely because the dot is integer.

// gemm_w8a8_reg — the int8 twin of gemm_f32_reg (audit M-12).
//
// gemm_w8a8_tiled above computes ONE output per thread with byte-granular
// shared staging: its PTX is 32 ld.shared.u8 per 4 dp4a. That is LSU-bound, not
// MAC-bound, and the roofline campaign measured the same shape at 360 GMAC/s
// against this card's 4876 GMAC/s dp4a roof — 7% — then RETIRED it from the ANN
// path (anncuda/gemv_w8a8.cu). The retirement never reached the ViT path, where
// every int8 projection still ran it: ~300 GMAC per so400m image, ~0.83 s.
//
// Two changes, both from gemm_f32_reg's playbook:
//
//   PACKED-WORD STAGING. Shared memory holds int (four int8), not signed char,
//   so one ld.shared.u32 feeds a whole dp4a instead of four ld.shared.u8 feeding
//   a quarter of one. A is reinterpreted as int* with K/4 words per row, which
//   is why K%4 is required; device allocations are 256-byte aligned so the row
//   starts are too.
//
//   4x4 REGISTER BLOCKING. Each thread owns a 4x4 micro-tile, so the 8 shared
//   words it loads per k-word feed 16 dp4a rather than 1. Per 16-element k-step
//   that is 32 ld.shared.u32 for 64 dp4a — 0.5 loads per dp4a against the tiled
//   kernel's 8, a 16x better ratio, which is the whole point since the kernel is
//   load-bound.
//
// K steps 16 elements (IBK=4 words) rather than gemm_f32_reg's 16 floats, so the
// alignment requirement stays K%16==0 — SigLIP-so400m's inter of 4304 is a
// multiple of 16 but NOT of 64, and a K%64 kernel would have missed the MLP
// projections that are most of the work.
//
// The epilogue is byte-for-byte gemm_w8a8_tiled's: an exact int32 accumulator
// scaled by aScale[m]*bScale[n] in the same order, so the two kernels agree
// exactly and GEMMW8A8Plan can route between them freely.
//
// Requires only K%16==0 (IBK words of four int8). M and N are free: edge tiles
// stage zeros and skip their stores, so the inner loop is still unguarded.
// GEMMW8A8Plan routes a K%16!=0 shape to gemm_w8a8_tiled.

// gemm_f32_reg — the register-blocked f32 GEMM (Phase 4 throughput).
//
// WHY THIS IS NOT A PORT OF METAL'S gemm_f32_sg_big. Metal's win came from dropping
// shared staging entirely and loading A/B fragments straight from device memory. That
// does not transfer, and the reason is the operand layout rather than the platform:
// A is [M,K] and B is [N,K], both row-major, so BOTH operands are contiguous along K.
// A thread owning output column n reads B[n*K + k] — consecutive threads are then K
// floats apart, so a staging-free load is fully uncoalesced. The existing tiled kernel
// is coalesced precisely BECAUSE it stages (consecutive threads read consecutive k).
//
// So this keeps shared staging to buy coalescing, and takes its speed from REGISTER
// BLOCKING instead: each thread computes a 4x4 micro-tile, so one shared load feeds 16
// FMAs instead of 1. Same idea as Metal's ("do more per thread"), opposite conclusion
// about staging, for a layout reason — measured, not assumed.
//
// Geometry: 64x64 output tile per block, K stepped 16 at a time, 256 threads (16x16),
// 4x4 outputs each. ALIGNED ONLY (M%64==0, N%64==0, K%16==0) so the inner loops carry
// no bounds checks; GEMMF32Plan routes everything else to gemm_f32_tiled.
//
// The shared arrays are padded by one float. Without the pad, As is [16][64] and a
// half-warp writing As[lc][lr] hits stride 64 — 64 % 32 == 0, so all 16 lanes land in
// ONE bank (a 16-way conflict). Padding to 65 makes the stride odd and the writes
// conflict-free. This is invisible in correctness and worth ~a third of the throughput.
