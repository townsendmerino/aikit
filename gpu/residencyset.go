// ResidencySet wraps MTLResidencySet (macOS 15+), which pins a set of allocations resident so the
// driver does NOT re-validate
// their residency on every command-buffer commit — the fix for the per-submit make-resident tax that
// dominates a per-layer-submit decode (measured ~15 ms/boundary of GPU-idle-in-wait, vs ~0.4 ms once
// a set is cached). Add the stable working set (always-on weights + slot buffers) ONCE, commit,
// requestResidency, and attach to the queue; every command buffer on that queue then finds the set
// already resident. NEW entry point — does not alter any existing API. Availability is the caller's
// responsibility: guard with ResidencySetsSupported (nil set / fallback path on older OSes).
