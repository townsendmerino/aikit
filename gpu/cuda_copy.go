// DeviceCopy is one src→dst pair for CopyDeviceBatch. Both buffers are read at

	Dst   Buffer
	Src   Buffer

// CopyDevice copies nBytes from src into dst, device to device, without a host
// round trip. Both buffers are read at their bind offsets. It returns only after
// the copy has completed — see the synchronization note below, which is the whole
// reason this function does more than forward to gocudrv.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS. Upload (host→device) and Download (device→host) were the only
// transfer verbs, so moving bytes between two device buffers meant a PCIe round
// trip through host memory. goinfer measured that at 8.1 ms for ~20 MiB of
// recurrent decoder state on an RTX 2070 SUPER — about one whole resident decode
// step, a full token's work, to snapshot state that was already on the device.
// The same bytes device-to-device cost ~446 µs. That is ~18×, and it moves the
// operation from "costs a token" to "costs a few percent of one".
//
// MEASURED HERE, 2070 SUPER, idle box, median of 5: one contiguous 20 MiB copy
// takes 0.127 ms — 165 GB/s of bytes copied, 331 GB/s of memory TRAFFIC, 74% of
// the card's 448 GB/s ceiling. Quote whichever you mean and say which: a DtoD
// copy reads n and writes n, so the two conventions differ by exactly 2× and the
// hardware ceiling bounds the traffic one. See trafficGBs in cuda_copy_test.go —
// that factor of two is why an earlier version of the test reported 37% for a
// copy running at 74%.
//
// THE SYNCHRONIZATION IS NOT INCIDENTAL — READ THIS BEFORE "OPTIMIZING" IT AWAY.
// The underlying gocudrv call dispatches cuMemcpyDtoD_v2, which the CUDA driver
// defines as ASYNCHRONOUS with respect to the host for device-to-device copies.
// It returns once the copy is enqueued, not once it is done. gocudrv's own
// CopyToDeviceAt doc comment claims "It blocks until the copy completes"; that
// claim does not match the driver's contract, and measurement agrees with the
// driver: timing the call alone on a 20 MiB copy reports ~9 µs of dispatch rather
// than ~116 µs of transfer, which works out to 8145 GB/s on a card whose physical
// ceiling is 448 GB/s. Not a suspicious number — an impossible one.
//
// So this verb synchronizes explicitly, and its contract is "the bytes are there
// when it returns". That matches Upload, which also synchronizes, and it means a
// caller cannot accidentally read a half-copied buffer. A caller who genuinely
// wants overlap should reach for CopyDeviceBatch, which pays one synchronize for
// many copies rather than one each.

// CopyDeviceBatch issues every copy and then synchronizes ONCE, which is the
// form the motivating consumer actually needs and the reason it is not just a
// loop over CopyDevice at the call site.
//
// WHY THE BATCH FORM EARNS ITS KEEP. The single-copy number flatters what callers
// see. One contiguous 20 MiB device-to-device copy runs at ~347 GB/s (78% of a
// 2070 SUPER's 448 GB/s peak). The real consumer does not issue one copy — it
// issues 36 (18 layers × two buffers, 73 KB and 1 MiB each), and that shape runs
// at ~174 GB/s of traffic, 39% of peak (reproduced here: 172.5 GB/s median of 5,
// against 331 for the contiguous shape), because a small copy is dominated by its ~9 µs of
// dispatch rather than by bandwidth. Batching removes 35 of the 36 synchronizes,
// and coalesce (copy_coalesce.go) removes whole dispatches wherever the caller's
// pairs are already adjacent. Benchmark both shapes before quoting a number
// (BenchmarkCopyDevice_contiguous vs BenchmarkCopyDevice_manySmall).
//
// Every pair is validated before any CUDA call, so a bad pair fails without
// leaving some copies issued and others not.
