// HostCopy is one host→device pair for UploadBatch: Src's bytes go into Dst at
// Dst's bind offset (Buffer.At).
//
// Src is []byte rather than a generic []T because a batch is heterogeneous by
// nature — the motivating caller loads an expert's f32 weights and its f16 scales
// in the same pass — and a generic batch would force one element type across all
// of them. Both of that caller's sites already hold byte slices for the same
// reason, so this costs nothing at the call site. Upload[T] stays generic; this
// is the byte-level sibling, not a replacement.
type HostCopy struct {
	Dst Buffer
	Src []byte
}

// UploadBatch uploads every pair and then synchronizes ONCE.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS: THE SYNC COUNT IS THE COST, NOT THE COPY. Upload ends in a full
// device Synchronize — correct, and cheap when uploads are per-request (a corpus, a
// tower, a batch of patches), which is what it was written for. goinfer's C′ expert
// cache is the case it was not: a MoE decode token loads ~120 expert slots, two
// uploads each, so ~240 synchronizes land on a single token. Measured on an RTX
// 2070 SUPER that is ~3.6 ms of a 64 ms token — 5.6%, paid for nothing, since the
// bytes are already in flight and one sync at the end would have covered them all.
//
// This does exactly that: issue all the copies, wait once. It is the H2D twin of
// CopyDeviceBatch, and the same reasoning produced both.
//
// WHAT IT DOES NOT DO — and this was checked against the caller rather than assumed.
// It does not coalesce adjacent pairs the way CopyDeviceBatch does. On that path
// merging pays because a snapshot walks contiguous ranges; here it would collapse
// nothing. goinfer's loadExpertSlot derives its source offset from the ROUTED
// EXPERT index and its destination offset from the LRU VICTIM slot:
//
//	src: e    * perExpert   // which expert routing picked
//	dst: slot * perExpert   // which slot the LRU evicted
//
// Those two are independent, so consecutive loads are essentially never adjacent in
// BOTH — which is what merging requires — and the two uploads within one expert
// target different buffers (weights and scales) so they cannot merge either. A
// coalescing pass would be a linear scan that always returns its input. If a caller
// with genuinely contiguous ranges turns up, revisit; the code is in copy_coalesce.go.
//
// THE CORRECTNESS PROPERTY IS PRESERVED, NOT WEAKENED. Upload's synchronize exists
// for a real race — gocudrv streams are CU_STREAM_NON_BLOCKING and unordered against
// the legacy null stream, and cuMemcpyHtoD from PAGEABLE memory returns once the
// source is staged with the transfer still in flight. It surfaced once as an
// intermittently wrong GEMM. This batch still synchronizes before it returns, so the
// guarantee a caller gets is identical; only its cost is amortized. That is the whole
// difference from the async proposal, which buys the same 3.6 ms but moves ordering
// into a contract on the caller (see goinfer's aikit-subrange-async-upload.md, and
// its decision).
//
// Every pair is validated before any copy is issued, so a bad pair fails without
// leaving half the batch applied.
