//go:build linux

// cuda.go is the CUDA half of aikit's cgo-free GPU device substrate — the Linux
// mirror of metal.go (docs/task-native-gpu.md, Phase 1b). It presents the SAME
// vocabulary as the Metal impl — Device / Buffer / Queue / Pipeline / Encoder,
// CreateSystemDefaultDevice, NewBuffer*, Run1D, Begin/Dispatch/End, and the
// allocation ledger (ReleaseAll / ReleaseBuf / ReleaseObjects / LedgerLen) — so a
// consumer reads the same on both platforms. The two files are build-tag mutually
// exclusive (darwin vs linux), so the shared type names never collide.
//
// It is a thin wrapper over github.com/eitamring/gocudrv, which dlopens libcuda
// and is cgo-free by construction (CGO_ENABLED=0 throughout). No aikit imports —
// the device layer stays ann-free, exactly like metal.go.
//
// # Three places the CUDA surface deliberately diverges from Metal
//
//  1. **Host memory is not device memory.** Apple's UMA lets an MTLBuffer's
//     contents be a zero-copy Go slice, so metal.go's Floats/Int8s/SetU32 both
//     read AND write device memory in place. A discrete NVIDIA GPU has no such
//     mapping, so faking those views would silently drop writes. Transfers are
//     therefore EXPLICIT here: Upload/SetU32 upload, Download reads back into
//     caller-owned storage. Same buffer constructors, explicit traffic.
//
//  2. **Dispatch launches whole blocks.** Metal's dispatchThreads launches
//     EXACTLY n threads, so its kernels need no bounds check. CUDA launches
//     ceil(n/tg) blocks of tg threads, so the tail block overruns n. Every kernel
//     run through this layer MUST guard its global index against its own count
//     parameter — see gpu/anncuda's kernels for the shape.
//
//  3. **Failures are returned, not swallowed.** Metal's Run1D/Dispatch/End are
//     infallible (objc msgSend has nothing to report); cuLaunchKernel does. These
//     return error rather than let a failed launch read back as a buffer of zeros
//     — an OOM or a bad grid wearing a parity bug's clothes.
//
// # Thread affinity
//
// A CUDA context is bound to an OS thread, so a per-call dispatch from a
// migrating goroutine is an intermittent-crash generator — the same class of bug
// NSAutoreleasePool caused on the Metal side (see gpu/annmetal's runLocked).
// Nothing here needs runtime.LockOSThread: gocudrv's Context OWNS a dedicated
// runtime.LockOSThread'd executor goroutine and funnels every driver call
// (alloc, memcpy, launch, sync) through it. The affinity guarantee is structural,
// which is why this file has no pinning of its own.
